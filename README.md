# HMMM Start Learning Android Development -_-

[17 Feb 2018 22:07 GMT+7] Start learning it. I don't know where to start, though -_-

[17 Feb 2018 23:27 GMT+7] Allright, I've pushed my first lesson. It was about sending POST request with form-urlencoded and application/json. I used retrofit2 and rxjava2 library.

[19 Feb 2018 22:24 GMT+7] New lesson: a GET request with Retrofit2 and RxJava2.
