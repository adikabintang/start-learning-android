# HMMM Start Learning Android Development -_-

## Log
[17 Feb 2018 22:07 GMT+7] Start learning it. I don't know where to start, though -_-

[17 Feb 2018 23:27 GMT+7] Allright, I've pushed my first lesson. It was about sending POST request with form-urlencoded and application/json. I used retrofit2 and rxjava2 library.

[19 Feb 2018 22:24 GMT+7] New lesson: a GET request with Retrofit2 and RxJava2.

[20 Feb 2018 22:31 GMT+7] I admit I did it the wrong way. I should've learned <i>Intent</i> before learning retrofit. Actually I had learned it but I forgot it. Now I am taking it again and I push it here.

[8 Mar 2018 08:51 GMT+7] I skipped writing this log because I forgot to do it. Latest push was about setting autofocus on CameraSource and adding an example of a very simple read and write file.

[8 Mar 2018 23:09 GMT+7] Learn saving a simple key-value store using <i>SharedPreferences</i>
