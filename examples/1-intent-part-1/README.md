# First Application Using EditText, Button, and Intent

## Where is it from
Tutorial: https://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/index.html

## Notes I take for myself:
- Create another activity by clicking the app root project then New->Activity
- If an <i>Activity</i> needs to bring something to another <i>Activity</i>, use <i>Intent</i>
- an Intent method, the <i>putExtra</i>, brings the value in key value format, and <b>it is a good practice to use the package name as the prefix for the key</b>. Key example: com.mycompany.firstintention.
